-- TASK 5 - DIFFERENT  DATA TYPES
-- TASK 15 - DUPLICATE CHECK (each table holds unique data for each entry, no duplicates can happen)
-- TASK 2 - PRIMARY and FOREIGN KEYS 1/2
-- TASK 6 2/2

-- Creating the book table
-- PRIMARY KEY is a constraint hat makes sure that each value in the column is unique and not NULL.
-- AUTO_INCREMENT: for each new record added  to the table, it will generate an integer (x + 1). No duplicates.
-- price set to be up to 10 digits in total of which 2 digits are decimals.
-- Addded a CHECK for StockQuantity and Price (to avoid negative stock quantity and price 0 or less .
CREATE TABLE book (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    stock_quantity INT NOT NULL,
    CHECK (price > 0),
    CHECK (stock_quantity >= 0)

-- Creating the Customers table
-- UNIQUE added for the email addresses.
CREATE TABLE customer (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,

);

-- TASK 2 - PRIMARY and FOREIGN KEYS 2/2
-- Creating the Orders table
-- FOREIGN KEY usage: links two tables together. In this case links the CustomerID field in the Customers table. 
-- A customer can have multiple orders but each order is linked to different customers.

    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    customer_id INT NOT NULL,
